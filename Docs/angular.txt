Angular services are singletons objects or functions that carry out specific tasks common to web apps. Angular has a number of built in services, such as the $http service,





I can trace Angular’s beginnings to 2009, on a project called Google Feedback. We’d
gone through months of frustration with our development speed and ability to write
testable code. At around the six month mark, we had around 17,000 lines of front-end
code. At that point, one of the team members, Misko Hevery, made a bold statement
that he’d be able to rewrite the whole thing in two weeks using an open source library
that he’d created as a hobby.
I figured that a two week delay couldn’t hurt us that much and we’d at least be entertained
by Misko scrambling to build something. Misko missed his time estimate. It took three
weeks. We were all astounded, but even more astounding was that the line count for
this new app had dropped from 17,000 to a mere 1,500. It seemed that Misko was onto
something worth pursuing.

Bundling and Minification
=========================
bundling-concatening multiple files into single file
minification-making download size as small as possible

decreases download time
